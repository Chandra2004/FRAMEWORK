# 🚀 Introduction to The Framework

**The Framework** is a lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly MVC native PHP framework. It is designed for developers who want the power of modern frameworks like Laravel but with zero overhead and full control over every line of code.

## Key Features

- **Extreme Security:** Built-in CSRF, WAF, and input sanitization.
- **High Performance:** Lightweight architecture with minimal dependencies.
- **Laravel-like DX:** Eloquent-like ORM, Artisan-like commands, and familiar routing.
- **Production Ready:** Optimized for speed and security out of the box.

## Why Choose The Framework?

If you're tired of "black box" frameworks where you don't know what's happening under the hood, The Framework is for you. Every component is designed to be readable, extensible, and secure.
